# React Concept: 

- Use react routing and nested routing
- Create dynamic route
- useState and useEffect use
- also use useNavigate and context api and many more.

I used to handle and managing data hold in a state by using useEffect hook and also when i making cart and wish list section i used context api to add and get data from localstorage.

- By clicking card details button open a dynamic route that show specific product details.
- User can select item on cart and wish list.
- In dashboard route can see cart and wishlist item that user selected, and can remove them.
